Add `hyper-oldschool` to the plugins list in your `~/.hyper.js` config file and restart Hyper.


## Tip

To get the exact same look as in the screenshot, you need to use the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt, Menlo font, and the [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugin to have commands highlighted.
